The sentence sounds good and i too believe in that.<br>

The Article by Daniel was useful and he explained each and every key design concepts with some pictorial representations that made me to feel like a UI design engineer.<br>

I was practicing some tags in html and found interesting working on floating the elements (text and images) using CSS . <br>

Cascading is also an interesting topic to cover.You can find the code below to view the floating and cascading using css.<br>
