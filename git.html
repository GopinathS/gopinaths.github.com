<h3 class="shadow">GIT - Distributed Version Control System  :    </h3>


  <p>I was referring a book from the source (Progit ) , it is really good source for all the beginners .<br>
  It really helped me understand from scratch which means the book has enough information to set up the GIT , about commands , customization and lot more.
<br>

                  This book really helped me to understand what is distributed version control system and its advantages over VCN & CVCN (Centralized Version Control System).<br>
                  The three states of GIT and scope of each state is awesome. At the end of first chapter , i had installed git in my machine successfully.<br>


              1. To create a new repository<br>
              2. To clone the existing repository from remote.<br>
              3. Modifying,staging and committing the changes and  viewing the  history and tagging..<br>



Branching is the very important topic in GIT because it takes us to from start to end. I mean from memory management to branch management.
<br>
 The technique followed for the branching is  awesome and that makes difference between other VCS.
<br>
     In this topic , we had an exercise to create a branch in our machine and i tried to pull a branch from the admin account and it worked fine.
<br>
Cloning the repository by using different protocols is quiet interesting and useful too.
