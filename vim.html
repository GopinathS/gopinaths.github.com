       <p>

        We can divide the tasks which we perform in/on
text files.<br>

        1)  Creating the file :<br>
           
               $ vim <filename><br>
               $ gvim <filename>Nbr>

<p class="border" />
        2)  Exiting the file.<br>
           
              :q  ---->   Quit Vim. This fails when changes have been made.<br>
              :q[uit]! ---->    Quit without writing.<br>
              :cq[uit]   ---->  Quit always, without writing.<br>
              :wq   ---->  Write the current file and exit.<br>
              :wq!   ---->  Write the current file and exit always.<br>
              :wq {file} ---->    Write to {file}. Exit if not editing the last<br>
              :wq! {file}   ---->  Write to {file} and exit always.<br>
               ZZ   ---->  Write current file, if modified, and exit.<br>
               ZQ   ---->  Quit current file and exit (same as ":q!").<br>

        3)  Modifying the fie,<br>

             Now we reached a  very important section where lots of operations are performed like searching , replacing , deleting etc.....
<br>
       Searching for an interesting option which makes Vim a champion ....<br>
